Vector representation of word has been learned by many methods,  word2vec is one of them and used in many natural language processing and information retrieval to detect word similarity, analogical reasoning and so on. Though vector representation of word has been applied for DBpedia data regarding the relational task, the surprising fact is that it has not been yet applied to aggregate semantic information stored in word embeddings. This project target is to increase the accuracy of analogical reasoning by aggregating semantic information of DBpedia data to predict the relation targets. Therefore, we introduced two super vectors, whose are capable to accumulate several vectors in the analogy task and whose can incredibly increase the accuracy of the analogous characteristic of the vectors.  The following four relations namely capital-country, currency-country, person-party and company-headquarter are considered from DBpedia for this study to evaluate the system performance. With the increasing number of vectors, the performance has increased for all of the above-described relations and the highest performance has achieved by the company-headquarter relation.
