Vector representation of words has been learned by many method,
word2vec is one of them and useful in many natural language process-
ing and information retrieval. Though, surprising fact is that Vector
representation of words have not been applied for Dbpedia data to
aggregate semantic information stored in word embeddings to predict
dbpedia properties . In this paper, I am focusing on how Vector repre-
sentation of words from word2vec can be applied for Dbpedia proper-
ties in order to get missing information. The main goals of Predicting
relation targets of DBPedia properties using vector representations
from word2vec are to fnd corresponding resources from the Dbpedia
and to apply Word2Vec technique to find missing information.
