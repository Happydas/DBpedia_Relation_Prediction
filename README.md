                        Abstract
Vector representation of words has been learned by word2vec and
useful in many natural language processing and information retrieval.
Though, surprising fact is that word2vec have not been applied for
Dbpedia data. In this paper, I am focusing on how word2vec can
be applied for Dbpedia properties in order to get missing informa-
tion. The main goals of Extracting Vector Representation of Dbpedia
Properties are to nd corresponding resources from the Dbpedia and
to apply Word2Vec technique to nd missing information.
